        <h3>1.</h3>
        <p>a) The ability to learn, understand, and apply knowledge to solve problems and adapt to new situations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3></h3>
        <p>b) A branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding language.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3></h3>
        <p>c) An entity that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve specific goals, which can be either humans or machines.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3></h3>
        <p>d) The quality of making decisions or taking actions based on reason and logic to achieve the best possible outcome.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3></h3>
        <p>e) The process of using structured, formal methods to derive conclusions or make decisions based on premises or known facts.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>2.</h3>
        <p>Reflex actions are not considered rational in a cognitive sense because they occur automatically in response to stimuli without conscious thought. They are also not intelligent in the sense of deliberate problem-solving; rather, they are instinctual responses designed for survival.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>3.</h3>
        <p>Introspection can be inaccurate due to cognitive biases, memory distortions, and the complexity of our thoughts. One might misinterpret their feelings or fail to recognize influences on their thoughts, leading to a situation where they may be wrong about what they believe they're thinking or feeling</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>4.</h3>
        <p>a) Supermarket bar code scanners: Very low level of AI. They perform a simple pattern recognition task but don't adapt or learn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3></h3>
        <p>b) Web search engines: Moderate to high level of AI. They use complex algorithms to understand queries, rank results, and often employ machine learning to improve over time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3></h3>
        <p>c) Voice-activated telephone menus: Low to moderate level of AI. They use speech recognition, which is an AI technology, but most systems have limited understanding and adaptability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3></h3>
        <p>d) Internet routing algorithms: Moderate level of AI. They make dynamic decisions based on current conditions, which involves some degree of problem-solving and adaptation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>5.</h3>
        <p>Evolution and rationality:
            Evolution tends to favor systems that act rationally because rational behavior generally increases survival and reproductive success. The primary "goal" shaped by evolution is the propagation of genes. Systems that make better decisions in pursuit of survival and reproduction are more likely to pass on their genes, leading to the emergence of increasingly sophisticated and rational cognitive systems over time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>6.</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">AI as science or engineering:
            AI is both a science and an engineering discipline. As a science, it involves the study of intelligence and the development of theories about how intelligent behavior can be created. As an engineering discipline, it focuses on building intelligent systems and applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems. The field involves a continuous interplay between scientific inquiry and practical application.</p>

    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>7.</h3>
        <p>Computer intelligence:
            The statement "computers can do only what their programmers tell them" is an oversimplification. While computers follow instructions, modern AI systems, especially those using machine learning, can develop behaviors and solutions that weren't explicitly programmed. They can learn from data, generalize to new situations, and sometimes surprise their creators with novel approaches. Therefore, this statement doesn't necessarily imply that computers cannot be intelligent.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question-container">
        <h3>8.</h3>
        <p>Animal intelligence:
            The statement "animals can do only what their genes tell them" is also an oversimplification. While genes provide a blueprint for neural development and some instinctive behaviors, many animals, especially higher mammals, demonstrate learning, problem-solving, and even cultural transmission of knowledge. Their behavior is a complex interplay of genetic predispositions and environmental influences. This statement doesn't preclude animal intelligence, as intelligence can emerge from the interaction between genetic potential and environmental learning.</p>
